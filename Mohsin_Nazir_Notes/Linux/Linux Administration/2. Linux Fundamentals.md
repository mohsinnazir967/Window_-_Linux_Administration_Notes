# Linux Fundamentals

## File Permission

Permissions for a file or directory may be restricted to by types

**There are 3 type of permissions**

- *r* - read
- *w* - write
- *x* - execute = running a program

**Each permission (rwx) can be controlled at three levels:**

- *u* - user  = yourself
- *g* - group = can be people in the same project
- *o* - other = everyone on the system

**Command to change permission**

```
chmod
```

**+** to assign permission
**\-** to remove permission

Example

Assigning Users

```
chmod u+x <filename>
```

Assigning Group

```
chmod g+x <filename>
```

Assigning Others

```
chmod o+x <filename>
```

Assigning all at once

```
chmod a+x <filename>
```

## Permission using numeric mode

Actually, the values for permissions are as follows:

- **Read (r)**: 4
- **Write (w)**: 2
- **Execute (x)**: 1

Add these for permission values as follows below

**---** = *0*
**--x** = *1*
**-r-** = *2*
**-rw** = *3*
**r--** = *4*
**r-x** = *5*
**rw-** = *6*
**rwx** = *7*

**Example**

Full permission (rwx = 7) to all (ugo)

```
chmod 777 <filename>
```

Read Permission to (r-- = 4) to all

```
chmod 444 <filename>
```


## File Ownership

There are 2 owners of a file or directory
	*• User and group*

**Chown**

```
chown <username> <filename>
```

```
sudo chown root Beta
```

**Chgrp**

```
chgrp <username> <filename>
```

```
sudo chgrp root Alpha
```

## Access Control List (ACL)

- Giving permission to a specific user or a specific group provides flexibility.

**getfacl**  ---> *showing ACL respectively.*

```
getfacl <directory/filename>
 ```

```
getfacl patriot.txt
```
 
**setfacl**  ---> *used for setting up ACL*

*To add permissions for a user*

```
sefacl -m u:user:permissions /path/to/file
```

```
setfacl -m u:root:rwx patriot.txt 
```

*To add permission for a group*

```
setfacl -m g:group:permission /path/to/file
```

```
setfacl -m g:mohsin:rwx patriot.txt
```


*To allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within*

```
setfacl -R -m u:user:permissions /path/to/file
```

```
setfacl -R -m g:mohsin:r Alpha 
```

```
setfacl -R -m u:mohsin:r Alpha 
```

*To remove a specific entry*

```
setfacl -x u:user or group /path/to/file
```

```
setfacl -x u:mohsin patriot.txt 
```


```
setfacl -x g:root patriot.txt 
```


*To remove all entries*

```
setfacl -b /path/to/file
```

```
setfacl -b patriot.txt
```

## Help Commands

**whatis**

Little description about the command

```
whatis cat
```


**--help**
 
 Brief description of command and it's options.

```
cat --help
```

**man**

Detailed manual of the command.

```
man cat
```

## Adding Text to files

**echo** *>(overwrite) or >>(append)*

```
echo "Patriotism is in the Blood" > patriot.txt
```

```
echo "We are here to serve" >> patriot.txt
```

**Redirect command output** *>(overwrite) or >>(append)*

```
ls -l > list_dir.txt
```

```
date >> list_dir.txt
```

- Also the text editors nano, vi or mousepad etc

## Input and Output Redirects

**3 redirects in Linux**

1. Standard input (*stdin*) and it has file descriptor number as *0*

2. Standard output (*stdout*) and it has file descriptor number as *1*

3. Standard error (*stderr*) and it has file descriptor number as *2*

**Output(stdout) -1** 

Writing the out of the command to a file

*Overwrite*

```
ls -l > list_dir.txt
```

*Append*

```
ls -l >> list_dir.txt
```

**Input (stdin) - 0**

Taking the input from a file

```
cat < list_dir.txt
```

```
mail -s "Office memo" allusers@abc.com < memoletter
```

**Error (stderr) - 2**

Writing the errors of commands to the the file.

```
ls -l root 2> errofile
```

## Standard Output to a File (tee)

- tee command is used to store and view (both at the same time) the output of the command.

```
ls -l | tee out&view.txt
```

## Pipes |

A pipe is used by the shell to *connect* the *output of one command* directly to the *input of another command.*


```
ls -l | more
```

```
ls -l | tail -1
```

## File maintenance commands

**Coping files** 

```
cp <source> <destionation>
```

```
cp patriot.txt warrior.txt
```

```
cp patriot.txt /home/user/Downloads
```

for directories use -r

```
cp -r Beta /home/sulmanasif/Downloads/
```


**Removing Files**

for files

```
rm patriot.txt
```

for directories

```
rm -r Alpha
```

**Moving & Renaming Files**

```
mv <source> <destination>
```

```
mv Beta /home/sulmanasif/LinuxPractice/
```


## Files Display Commands

**cat** 

Display the whole files at one

```
cat patriot.txt
```

**more**

Display the file page by page

```
 more dmesg
```

**less**

Navigate both forward and backward order, one line at time, versatile than more

```

```

**head**

Display the top lines, specify the lines with -.

```

```
tail -5 dmesg
```

## Filters / Text Processors Commands

#### cut 

cut is a command line utility that allows you to *cut parts of lines from specified files or piped data* and
print the result to standard output. 

It can be used to *cut* parts of a line by *delimiter*, *byte position*, and *character*.

**List one character**

```
cut -c1 cutfile
```

**Multiple  character**

```
cut -c1,2,3 cutfile
```

**List range of characters**

```
cut -c1-4 cutfile
```

**List multiple specific range of characters**

```
cut -c1-3,6-8 cutfile
```

**List by byte size**

```
cut -b1-3 cutfile
```

**List column separated by delimiter(" ")**

```
cut -d" " -f 1 cutfile 
```

**Pipe with other command**

```
ls -l | cut -c2-4
```

#### awk

awk is a utility/language designed for data extraction. Most of the time it is used to extract fields from a file or from an output

**List the first filed from the file**

```
awk '{print $1}' datafile
```

**List Multiple files**

```
awk '{print $1,$2}' datafile 
```

**Search for a specific word in file**

```
awk '/Mohsin/ {print}' datafile
```

**List the filed by delimiter** 

```
sudo awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
```

**List file based on length**

list all the files greater then 15 bytes.

```
awk 'length($0) > 5' datafile
```

**Pipe with other commands**

*Pipe with ls -l*

List the first and third fields.

```
ls -l | awk '{print $1,$3}'
```

List the last field.

```
ls -l | awk '{print $NF}'
```

Total number of fields

```
ls -l | awk '{print NF}'
```

Getting the matched field

```
ls -l | awk '{if($9="Alpha") print $0;}'
```

*Pipe with cat* 

Replace words field words

```
cat datafile | awk '{$2="SOC"; print $0}'
```


#### grep & egrep

The grep command which stands for “global regular expression print,” processes text line by line
and prints any lines which match a specified pattern

**grep** 

*Search for a keyword from a file*

```
grep mohsin datafile
```

*Search for a keyword and count*

```
grep -c mohsin datafile
```

*Search for a keyword ignore case-sensitive*

```
grep -i mohsin datafile
```

*Display the matched lines and their line numbers*

```
grep -ni mohsin datafile
```

*Display everything but not keyword*

```
grep  -vi mohsin datafile
```

*grep | awk* (Search for a keyword and then only give the 1st filed)

```
grep -i mohsin datafile | awk '{print $1}'
```

*grep | ls*

```
ls -l | grep Alpha
```

**egrep**

*search multiple keywords*

```
egrep -i 'mohsin|nazir' datafile 
```

#### sort/uniq

**sort** 

*sorts file in alphabetical order*

```
sort datafile
```

*Sort in reverse alphabetical order*

```
sort -r datafile 
```

*Sort by field number*

```
sort -k2 datafile
```


**uniq**

Filters out the repeated or duplicate lines.

*Always sort first before using uniq their line numbers*

```
sort datafile | uniq
```

*Sort first then uniq and list count*

```
sort datafile | uniq -c
```

*Only show repeated lines.*

```
sort datafile | uniq -d
```

#### wc

The command reads either standard input or a list of files and generates: newline count, word
count, and byte count.

*Check file line count, word count and byte count*

```
wc datafile
```

*Get the number of lines in a file*

```
wc -l datafile
```

*Get the number of words in a file*

```
wc -w datafile
```

*Get the number of bytes in a file*

```
wc -c datafile
```

*Listing number of files in a directory*

```
ls -l | wc -l 
```

number of files = result - 1

*Number of directories trick*

```
ls -l | grep drw | wc -l
```

*Number of keyword lines.*

```
grep -i mohsin datafile | wc -l 
```

## Filters / Text Processors Commands

**diff** ---> Compare files line by line

```
diff <file01> <file02>
```

```
diff datafile compfile 
```

**cmp** ---> compare files bit by bit

```
cmp <file01> <file02>
```

```
cmp datafile compfile
```

## Compress and un-Compress files

**tar**

Put all the files together in one container.

*creating tar files*

```
tar -vcf downdata.tar /home/sulmanasif/Downloads/
```

*extracting tar files*

```
tar -xcf downdata.tarcd 
```


**gzip**

Actually compress the files.
Compress the files not the directories

*Creating gzip files*

```
gzip dmesg
```

Extracting gzip files

```
gzip -d dmesg
```

## Truncate File Size (truncate)

The Linux truncate command is often
used to shrink or extend the size of a file to
the specified size.

It cut the file and loos the content in case of size shrink and add dummy data for size extend.

```
truncate -s 50 datafile
```

## Combining & Splitting Files

**Combining files** 

Multiple files can be combined into one

```
cat splitfilesaa splitfilesab splitfilesab >> jointfile
```

**Splitting files**

One file can be split into multiple files

```
split -l 2 compfile splitfiles
```

## Windows vs Linux Commands

**Copy a file** *copy* cp

**Move file** *move* mv

**Clear screen** *cls* clear

**Delete file** *del* rm

**Compare contents of files** *fc* diff

**Search for a word/string in a file** *find* grep
