```
sed 's/Iqbal/Iqbal Khan/g' datafile
```

it just make change to output on terminal, for changes in the file use -i option.

```
sed -i 's/Iqbal/Iqbal Khan/g' datafile
```

Remove string except specified.

```
sed '5!s/Mohsin/Moh/g' datafile 
```

*Remove the string*

```
sed -i 's/Khan//g' datafile
```


*Find and delete a line*

```
sed '/Abdul Wahab/d' datafile
```

*Remove empty lines*

```

```

## User Account Management

*Commands*

• useradd
• groupadd
• userdel
• groupdel
• usermod

*Files*

• /etc/passwd
• /etc/group
• /etc/shadow

*Example:*

```
useradd –g superheros –s /bin/bash –c “user description” –m –d /home/spiderman spiderman
```

1. **`useradd`**: This is the command used to create a new user in a Linux system.
    
2. **`-g superheros`**: This option specifies the primary group for the new user. In this case, the user will be added to the `superheros` group.
    
3. **`-s /bin/bash`**: This sets the login shell for the new user to `/bin/bash`.
    
4. **`-c “user description”`**: This option allows you to add a comment or description for the user. Here, it is set to "user description".
    
5. **`-m`**: This option creates the user's home directory if it does not already exist.
    
6. **`-d /home/spiderman`**: This specifies the home directory for the new user. In this case, it will be `/home/spiderman`.
    
7. **`spiderman`**: This is the username for the new user.

#### users

***Adding a user*** 

*adding user with useradd.*

```
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -c "Papu Shah" -m -d /home/papu papu
```

*Adding password to the users*

```
sudo cat /var/log/auth.log
```

## System Maintenance Commands

**shutdown**

```
sudo shutdown
```

**init 0-6**

The `init` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to change the runlevel of the system. Runlevels define the state of the machine after boot. Here’s a brief overview of the standard runlevels from 0 to 6:

1. **`init 0`**:
    
    - **Runlevel 0**: Shuts down the system. This is used to halt the system safely.
2. **`init 1`**:
    
    - **Runlevel 1**: Single-user mode. This is used for administrative tasks and maintenance. Only the root user can log in, and networking is usually disabled.
3. **`init 2`**:
    
    - **Runlevel 2**: Multi-user mode without networking. This is rarely used in modern systems.
4. **`init 3`**:
    
    - **Runlevel 3**: Multi-user mode with networking. This is a common runlevel for servers.
5. **`init 4`**:
    
    - **Runlevel 4**: Undefined. This runlevel is usually not used and can be customized for specific needs.
6. **`init 5`**:
    
    - **Runlevel 5**: Multi-user mode with networking and graphical user interface (GUI). This is the default runlevel for most desktop systems.
7. **`init 6`**:
    
    - **Runlevel 6**: Reboots the system. This is used to restart the system safely.

```
sudo init 0
```

**reboot**

```
sudo reboot
```

**halt** 

```
sudo halt
```

## Changing System Host name

hostname file

```
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

```
sudo cat /etc/hostname
```

changing hostname

```
hostnamectl set-hostname patriot
```

## Finding System Information

**dmidecode**

used to *retrieve hardware information* from the system's BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). It provides detailed information about the *system's hardware components, such as the processor, memory, and motherboard*.

```
sudo dmidecode
```

**uname -a** 

provides a comprehensive overview of your system's kernel and architecture.

```
uname -a
```

**Finding architecture**

```
arch
```

## Terminal Control Keys

Several key combinations on your keyboard usually have a special effect on the terminal.


The most common control keys are listed below:

**CTRL-u-** erase everything you've typed on the command line

**CTRL-c-** stop/kill a command

**CTRL-z-** suspend a command

**CTRL-d-** exit from an interactive program (signals end of data).

## Terminal Commands

**clear**

Clears your screen

```
clear
```

**exit**

Exit out of the shell, terminal or a user session

```
exit
```

**script**

The script command stores terminal activities in a log file that can be
named by a user, when a name is not provided by a user, the default
file name, typescript is used

```
script <filename>
```

```
script commands_to_cat_file
```


## Recover Root Password

Restart your computer
Edit grub
Change password
reboot

## SOS Report

Collect and package diagnostic and support data

**Usage**

version check

```
sos-version
```

Generating report

```
sosreport
```

## Environment Variables

An environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the way
running processes will behave on a computer. They are part of the environment
in which a process runs.

In simple words: set of defined rules and values to build an environment

*To view all environment variables*

```
env
```

*To view ONE environment variable*

```
echo $SHELL
```

*To set the environment variables*

```
export TEST=1
```

```
echo $TEST
```

*To set environment variable permanently*

```
vi .bashrc
```

```
TEST=‘123’
```

```
export TEST
```

*To set global environment variable permanently*

```
vi /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc
```

```
Test=‘123’
```

```
export TEST
```

## Special Permissions with setuid, setgid and sticky

All permissions on a file or directory are referred as bits.

There are 3 additional permissions in Linux.

**setuid:**

bit tells Linux to run a program with the effective user id of the owner instead of the executor:
(e.g. passwd command) → /etc/shadow

```
ls -l /usr/bin/passwd 
```

**setgid:**

bit tells Linux to run a program with the effective group id of the owner instead of the executor:
(e.g. at , plocate, crontab command)

```
usr/bin/chage
```

*Please note: This bit is present for only files which have executable permissions*

**sticky bit:**

a bit set on files/directories that allows only the owner or root to delete those files.

#### Usage of Setuid & Setgid & Sticky Bit 

**Setuid & Setgid**

To assign special permissions at the user level (setuid)

```
chomod u+s xyz.sh
```

To assign special permissions at the group level (setgid)

```
chmod g+s xyz.sh
```

To remove special permissions at the user or group level

```
chmod u-s xyz.sh
```

```
chmod g-s xyz.sh
```


To find all executable in Linux with setuid and setgid permissions

```
find / -perm /6000 -type f
```

*Please note:*
*These bits work on c programming executable not on bash shell scripts*

**Stickey Bit**

It is assigned to the *last bit* of permissions

r w x r w x r w **t**

Example of **/tmp** directory

```
chmod +t <path/directory/file>
```

```
chmod +t Alpha
```
